# Instructions
The goal of these instructions is that you can run the daily tests and solutions with the Go programming language.

## Tests
The tests are running the program with the short example input from the adventofcode.com website. With the tests you can check if you are using the correct logic. The tests are defined in the solve_test.go files.

Go into the daily directory and run the tests with `go test`

## Solutions
To run the program with your own data input to get the solutions, use the solve.go files.

Go into the daily directory and the program with `go run .`
